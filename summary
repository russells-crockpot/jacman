	JacMan is not just a Pac-Man clone. While it uses the same form of AI that the original Pac-Man uses (a finite state machine), it also includes another form of AI: an artificial nueral network. The network can learn while using either the ANN its self of the FSM.
	Unfortunately, the ANN learns very slowly, and is ill suited for a game as simple as Pac-Man. Ultimately, putting an ANN in any Pac-Man clone is useless (but entertaining).
	This game follows many of the programming practices that professional game developers use. This, however, tends to go against many traditional programming practices. This being said, I have attempted to make it easy to add new Items, and new features.
	Included is also a level editor. While there are two games hard-coded into the program itself, these are only used if a game file cannot be found.
